    <h2>Etymology</h2>

    <h4>
      "Boiler plate" originally referred to the maker's label used to identify
      the builder of steam boilers.[1]
    </h4>

    <p>
      In the field of printing, the term dates back to the early 1900s. From the
      1890s onwards, printing plates of text for widespread reproduction such as
      advertisements or syndicated columns were cast or stamped in steel
      (instead of the much softer and less durable lead alloys used otherwise)
      ready for the printing press and distributed to newspapers around the
      United States. By analogy, they came to be known as 'boilerplates'. One
      large supplier to newspapers of this kind of boilerplate was the Western
      Newspaper Union, which supplied "ready-to-print stories [which] contained
      national or international news" to papers with smaller geographic
      footprints, which could include advertisements pre-printed next to the
      conventional content.[2]
    </p>

    <p>
      Some companies also sent out press releases as boilerplate so that they
      had to be printed as written. The modern equivalent is the press release
      boilerplate, or "boiler," a paragraph or two that describes the company
      and its products.
    </p>

    <h2>Boilerplate Lan</h2>

    <h4>
      contractual law, the term "boilerplate language" describes the parts of a
      contract that are considered standard.
    </h4>

    <p>
      Boilerplate language may also exist in pre-created form letters on the
      Internet for such things as issues to be broached by a politician based on
      an issue ad, requests that a cable or satellite operator add a cable
      network to a system, pre-written complaints about a product that is
      opposed by groups that create such letters, or online petitions. The
      person requesting the action usually only needs to type or sign his or her
      name at the end of the pre-written greeting and body.
    </p>

    <h2>Boilerplate Code</h2>

    <p>
      In computer programming, boilerplate is the sections of code that have to
      be included in many places with little or no alteration. Such boilerplate
      is particularly salient when the programmer must include a lot of code for
      minimal functionality. The need for boilerplate can be reduced through
      high-level mechanisms.
    </p>

    A related phenomenon, bookkeeping code, is code that is not part of the
    business logic but is interleaved with it in order to keep data structures
    updated or able to handle secondary aspects of the program.
